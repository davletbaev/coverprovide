    <h2>What General Liability Insurance Is All About</h2>
    <p>Business is inherently risky, but business liability coverage safeguards against many known and unknown risks. Commercial general liability insurance coverage protects you, your business and your employees from claims involving bodily injury or property damage, up to the limits of your policy. Policies shield you from the expense of out-of-court settlements, litigation and judgments awarded by courts. It covers non-professional negligent acts only, and professional indemnity/ Worker Injury Compensation insurance should be considered too when structuring for a more comprehensive cover for your business.</p>
