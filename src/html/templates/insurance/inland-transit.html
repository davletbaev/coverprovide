    <h2>What Inland Transit Insurance Is All About</h2>
    <p>Road accidents are common in a densely populated city like Singapore, especially during morning rush hours or in congested areas like industrial parks or in city centre. Based on a 2016 report by Data.gov.sg, it is reported that the main causes of road accidents is mainly failing to keep a proper lookout or loss of control of the vehicle, of which could possibly lead to damages to the goods while in transit on land, hence the need for Inland Transit Insurance.</p>
    <p>The supplier would suffer a loss if the goods are damaged/destroyed while in transit to its destination, and the replacement cost would generally include the value of the goods destroyed, delivery cost, vehicle repair cost, and time.</p>
    <p>Businesses need to ensure that all stages of the supply chain are not disrupted (from manufacture to delivery). Having an Inland transit insurance is essential to protect against any loss of goods due to any unforseen circumstances while on the road.</p>

    <h2>How Much Does Inland Transit Insurance Cost?</h2>
    <p>Generally, the premium cost is greatly dependent on the goods/cargo in transit, and the distance of the voyage, and the nature of the business.</p>
    <p>High valued goods, OEM products or rare artefacts could raise the premium cost as the policy needs to cater for a higher indemnity amount to cover the cargo value. Large scaled deliveries (eg logistic or freight forwarding companies) would also command a higher premium amount as the policy will need to cover the entire fleet of vehicles.</p>
    <p>Land conveyance could be of a longer distance if it is an interstate delivery, or shorter if the delivery is within the city/town. The inherent risk of long hours driving could impede a driverâ€™s ability to stay focused on the road, which potentially could lead to accidents caused by fatigue.</p>
