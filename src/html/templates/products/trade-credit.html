    <h2>What Trade Credit Insurance Is All About</h2>
    <p>A sale that is not paid is essentially a gift…</p>
    <p>With Asia recording the highest increase in trade volume (8.1%) in 2017, local businesses are struggling to remain competitive as the world’s growth engine here in Asia has attracted many foreign competition to our shores. Credit risk today, if left unmanaged, poses much of a bigger problem as business owners offer more flexible payment terms in order to secure a deal.</p>
    <p>Trade receivables typically form almost 40% of a company’s asset, and a severe situation of overdue receivables could put a company out of business due to a negative cashflow position. Trade Credit Insurance indemnifies the insured against events of a debtor going default on their trade obligations, or in the worst case bankruptcy. It ensures business continuity, knowing that the insurance policy will pay out up to 90% of the invoice value should their buyer default on their payment.</p>
    <p>Partnering a specialist in Credit Insurance not only protects your receivables, but at the same time, gain access to buyers’ credit reports, market intelligence, claims recovery services…. All in a single trade credit policy.</p>

    <h2>What Is Trade Credit Insurance?</h2>
    <p>TCI can protect a business against the risk of non-payment of legally enforceable domestic and foreign debt obligations, which can occur due to commercial or political risks (in the case of international trade). The commercial risks covered are the insolvency of the buyer and protracted default, which is the failure to pay within a set number of days from the due date (usually 180 days).</p>
    <p>Political risk involves non-payment under an export contract due to the actions or inactions of a buyer’s government. These risks may include currency inconvertibility; transfer of payment; war; contract frustration and export licence cancellation.</p>
    <p>While indemnification for losses is what &lt;Name&gt; recognised as the main reason to seek TCI, it can also help the owner increase its sales and profits. For example, the insured’s credit department has granted a credit line of USD 100,000 to customer. It then put in place a TCI policy and the insurer approved a limit of USD 150,000 for that same customer. With a 5% margin and average turnover of 45 days, the insured would be able to increase its sales to realize an incremental annual gross profit of USD 20,000 on that one customer.</p>

    <p>The protection covers as standard goods or services are sold and delivered, but it can be tailored to cover pre-shipment and advance payment as well.</p>

    <h2>What Does Trade Credit Insurance Cover?</h2>
    <p>Trade credit insurance insures suppliers like yourself against the non-payment risk for goods despatched or services rendered by your buyers. The buyer may be located in the same country as you (domestic risk) or another country (export risk).</p>
    <p>The basic coverage usually insure the risk of non-payment resulting from:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Commercial risk – i.e. non-payment due to (i) insolvency of your buyer or (ii) non-payment after a specific time period  usually 6 months (vary depending on the insurers’ wordings) after the invoice due-date (often referred to as protracted default).</li>
      <li>Political risk – i.e. non-payment following a government’s action outside the control of your buyer or yourself (as seller), for example money cannot be transferred from your buyer’s country to your country known as Exchange Transfer risk.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Credit insurance can include a wider range of coverage such as pre-shipment, depending on your specific circumstances and needs.</p>

    <h2>How Much Does Trade Credit Insurance Cost?</h2>
    <p>The premium rate is generally given as a percentage of the insured’s insurable turnover. Obviously, the actual annual insurable turnover is not known at inception of the policy and so the final dollar amount of the premium is also not known. Therefore, a minimum premium amount is usually first established based on the applicable premium rate to the estimated annual insurable turnover as an integral part of the contract. Usually 80% to 85% of the estimated annual insurable turnover is used to compute the minimum premium amount.</p>
    <p>At the end of the policy year, the actual insurable turnover is used to calculate the final premium amount dues, and where it is higher than the minimum premium, an additional adjustment premium is paid by the insured to the insurer.</p>
    <p>Some of the variables influencing the premium rates include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Industry</li>
      <li>Insurable Turnover</li>
      <li>Pool of Customers offered for Insurance</li>
      <li>Customer Location (domestic or international, country risk)</li>
      <li>Creditworthiness of Customers</li>
      <li>Terms of Payment/ Payment Period</li>
      <li>Loss History (for past 3 years)</li>
      <li>Corporate Credit Management</li>
      <li>Policy Structure</li>
    </ul>
