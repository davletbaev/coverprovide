    <h2>What Protection is necessary for Wholesaler</h2>
    <p>Wholesalers are middleman in the supply chain, the linkage between the producer and the consumer. The key functions of wholesalers/ distributors include cushioning the manufacturers from volatility in product demand by stocking inventory, performing sales and after sales servicing roles to ensure customer satisfaction.</p>
    <p>Other common functions perform by wholesalers/distributors include inventory management, warehousing, logistics as well as customer support.</p>
    <p>Through value creation in the supply chain distribution model, there is inherent risk in its undertakings for different roles that the wholesaler takes, making cover protection against risk all the more important.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="inner-section container">
    <h2>Who exactly is the Wholesaler?</h2>
    <p>Wholesalers/distributors are companies that take inventory in bulk from manufacturers and occasionally raw materials producers and thereafter supply a suite of related product lines to its customers. Wholesaler undertakes the role of a purchaser, storeman, distributor, financier in their function, and assumes a wide spectrum of risk (liquidity, credit risk) associated with its trade.</p>
    
    <h4>[Role as a Purchaser]</h4>
    <p>Wholesalers would typically sell different varieties of a product line, supplying the market with a range of product in its class. Examples of a pulp & paper wholesaler would carry cardboards, paper, recycled paper, coated or uncoated paper, bond paper, etc.</p>

    <h4>[Role as a Storeman]</h4>
    <p>Wholesalers need a deep line of credit to operate its business, as inventories purchase would require huge capital outlay. They buy goods in large quantities, stocks goods in warehouses and ultimately sells in relatively smaller quantities to retailers/ end consumers.</p>

    <h4>[Role as a Distributor]</h4>
    <p>As a middleman, they facilitate the flow of goods from the producer to the consumers by employing a number of agents or workers for distribution of products. Wholesaler undertakes the responsibility of arranging for logistic & delivery of products in smaller quantities, hence relieving the producer from product sales.</p>

    <h4>[Role as Financier]</h4>
    <p>They act as the buyer for bulk purchases, making the sale process much easier for raw material supplier to offload their produce. These inventories will be sold in much smaller quantities with flexible credit terms, acting as the “banker” for both retailers/consumers.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="inner-section container">
    <h2>What Insurance does Wholesaler need?</h2>
    <p>A whole lot, actually…</p>
    <p>Due to the nature of its trade, wholesalers will need to create value in the supply chain by performing various functions (distributor, financier), otherwise it would merely be that of the transfer of goods from producer to consumer, making its role irrelevant.</p>
    <p>There is foreign exchange risk between purchase & sale of goods, storage cost of inventories, liquidity risk when inventories are not sold off, distribution cost in transporting goods from warehouse to consumers, credit risk when buyers default on their credit payments…</p>
    <p>Bankers & financial institutions are more willing to grant favourable trade facilities when the borrower has a robust credit management system. Without it, any incidents of loss or default in receivables collection could lead to possible bankruptcy of the company, should trade facilities be cancelled or reduced. As such, insurance protection is fundamental to its solvency & growth.</p>
